      <p>Albert Einstein became synonymous with genius after making several important scientific discoveries in the fields of mathematics and physics in the early 19th century which fundamentally changed the way we look at the world.</p>
      <p>He was born in Germany but later renounced his German citizenship becoming a Swiss national, however, he was unable to secure a teaching job in Switzerland and was forced to become an assistant in a patent clerk office in 1901. It was here he published
        his first academic paper and in 1905 the University of Zurich awarded him a doctorate.</p>
      <p>After publishing several more papers he was becoming well known within scientific circles and returned to Germany where he held several prestigious positions including the president of the German Physics Society. He was awarded a Nobel Prize in
        1921 for his service to theoretical physics and his work on the Photoelectric Effect.</p>
      <p>When Hitler came to power in Germany Albert decided to move to the US where he was greeted like royalty by President Roosevelt taking up a position at Princeton University and becoming a US citizen in 1940.</p>
      <p>15 years later at the age of 76, he died from internal bleeding which was marked with headlines throughout the world.</p>
